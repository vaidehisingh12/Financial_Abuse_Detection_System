-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Data Preprocessing
Transform raw data into a clean, consistent format ensuring that your data is ready for the next stages of analysis and machine learning.

      1. HANDLING MISSING VALUES
            Remove Missing Values: If the dataset is large and the number of missing values is small, you can remove rows or columns with missing values.
            Impute Missing Values: Replace missing values with a statistical measure such as the mean, median, or mode, or use more advanced techniques like interpolation or                  predictive modeling.
            
      2. CONVERTING DATA TYPES
            Ensure that each column in the dataset has the correct data type. For example, dates are converted to datetime objects, and categorical variables are                              converted to category types.
            
      3. NORMALIZING DATA
            Min-Max Scaling: Scales data to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
            Standardization: Scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

      4. ENCODING CATEGORICAL VALUES
            Label Encoding: Converts each category to a unique integer.
            One-Hot Encoding: Converts each category to a binary vector.

      5. FEATURE ENGINEERING
            Date Features: Extracting day of the week, hour of the day, etc., from date columns.
            Transaction Aggregates: Calculating the total transaction amount over a period of time.

      6. OUTLIER DETECTION AND REMOVAL
            Outliers can skew the results of the analysis and model training. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Feature Engineering 
converting raw data into meaningful features to detect suspicious patterns

      1. DATE AND TIME FEATURES
            Extracting date and time components from transaction timestamps can reveal patterns related to the time of day, day of the week, or even specific holidays.
            
      2. TRANSACTION AGGREGATES
            Calculating aggregate metrics over different time windows can help identify unusual transaction behaviors, such as a sudden increase in transaction amounts.
      
      3. FREQUENCY FEATURES
            Frequency features can capture the regularity of transactions, which might change in cases of financial abuse.
      
      4. RATIO FEATURES
            Ratios between different metrics can be useful for identifying anomalies. For example, the ratio of debits to credits might indicate unusual activity.
      
      5. CATEGORICAL ENCODING
            Categorical variables (e.g., transaction type, account type) need to be converted into numerical format. One common method is one-hot encoding.
      
      6. INTERACTION FEATURES
            Interaction features are created by combining two or more features. These can help capture complex relationships in the data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Model Training
   
I chose Random Forest Classifier as my model to train my system on for the following reasons:
      
      1. VERSATILITY: It can handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.
      
      2. ROBUSTNESS: It is less prone to overfitting compared to other models like Decision Trees.
      
      3. FEATURE IMPORTANCE: It provides insights into which features are most important for detecting financial abuse.
      
      4. PERFORMANCE: It generally performs well on a wide range of classification tasks, including anomaly detection.
      
      5. EASE OF USE: It has relatively few hyperparameters to tune.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Detection and Flagging

      1. LOAD AND PREPROCESS NEW DATA: Ensure new transaction data is preprocessed in the same way as our training data.
      
      2. LOAD THE TRAINED MODEL: Load the model trained previously.
      
      3. MAKE PREDICTIONS: Use the model to predict whether transactions are normal or suspicious.
      
      4. FLAG SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS: Identify and flag transactions predicted as suspicious.
      
      5. NOTIFY RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS: Alert the relevant stakeholders about suspicious transactions for further investigation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Reporting
   
      1. DEFINE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: Identify key metrics and information for the reports.
         
      2. GENERATE REPORTS: Create reports using tools like Pandas for CSV files or Jupyter Notebook for interactive reports.
         
      3. DISSEMINATE REPORTS: Distribute reports to stakeholders via email or other channels.
         
      4. REGULAR REPORTING SCHEDULE: Establish a regular schedule for reporting.
         
      5. REAL-TIME ALERTS: Set up real-time alerts for critical transactions

   2. CONTAINERIZE APPLICATION: Used Docker to create a portable application.

   3. API: Created an API to serve our model for real-time predictions.

   4. BUILD & RUN DOCKER CONTAINER
